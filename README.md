# 04-Code-Quiz

For this assignment we were tasked with creating a quiz.

This quiz must fit the fallowing criteria:

When you click the start button, a timer starts and you are presented with a question,

then when you answer the question you are presented with another question,

when a answer is answered incorrectly then time is subtracted from the clock.

When all questions have been answered or the time runs out, the game is over.

You are then able to save your score with your username.
